- Error messages distinguish between validation failures and injection attempts

### Backward Compatibility
- All legitimate table queries continue to work unchanged
- Only malicious or invalid table names are blocked
- Existing API surface remains the same

### Examples of Security Improvements

**Now blocked (would previously be vulnerable):**
```python
# These attempts are now blocked with clear error messages:
scanner.query_table_sample("users; DROP TABLE users;--", 10)
scanner.query_table_sample("users'; DELETE FROM users;--", 10)
scanner.query_table_sample("users UNION SELECT * FROM sensitive_data", 10)
```

**Still works (legitimate usage):**
```python
# These continue to work normally:
scanner.query_table_sample("users", 10)
scanner.query_table_sample("order_items", 50)
```

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-09

### Added
- **Configuration Validation**: Comprehensive validation for RAGConfig parameters
  - `similarity_search_k`: Must be positive integer â‰¤ 100
  - `table_sample_limit`: Must be positive integer â‰¤ 10000  
  - `vector_store_path`: Must be non-empty string or None
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Clear, specific validation error messages
- **Environment Variable Validation**: Validation applied to both direct instantiation and `from_env()` method
- **Performance Guards**: Upper limits prevent configurations that could cause performance issues

### Changed
- `RAGConfig.__post_init__()`: Now includes comprehensive parameter validation
- `RAGConfig.from_env()`: Enhanced with type conversion error handling
- README: Updated with configuration validation section and troubleshooting entries

### Technical Details
- Validation prevents runtime errors by catching invalid configurations at initialization
- Type checking ensures parameters are correct data types (int vs string/float)
- Range checking enforces reasonable bounds for performance and functionality
- Both programmatic and environment-based configuration methods are protected

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing valid configurations continue to work unchanged
- Default values remain the same (similarity_search_k=5, table_sample_limit=1000)
- Only invalid configurations that would have caused runtime errors are now caught earlier

### Examples of New Validations

**Will now raise errors:**
```python
RAGConfig(similarity_search_k=-1)        # ValueError: must be positive
RAGConfig(similarity_search_k=101)       # ValueError: must be <= 100
RAGConfig(table_sample_limit=0)          # ValueError: must be positive
RAGConfig(vector_store_path="")          # ValueError: cannot be empty
```

**Environment variables:**
```bash
SIMILARITY_SEARCH_K="invalid"            # ValueError: conversion error
SIMILARITY_SEARCH_K="-1"                 # ValueError: must be positive
```
